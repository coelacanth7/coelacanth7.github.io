I recently removed the jQuery from my code, and now I am working with primarily vanilla Javascript.

My intent for my personal website is to be super simple, and dynamically manage my online presence in one place. I also want to stay away from any libraries or frameworks and build all my javascript and css from the ground up so that it is fast, and it is mine.

The "$ hello" text is the only Javascript necessary for the page. It is implemented by setting a timer inside of a loop to add text incrementally.
